<h1>Claim your TF2 hat</h1>

<p>To claim your TF2 hat, you will need to log in to Steam by clicking the button below.</p>

<form method="post" action="/f2p/steam/auth">
  <input type="image" src="${static("images/steam.png")}" alt="log in with Steam">
</form>

<p>Note: we will not store the association between your Steam account and your
reddit account for longer than it takes to give you a hat.</p>
